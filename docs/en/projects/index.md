# Course Projects
The following are my selected course papers, in which we conducted empirical analyses on chosen topics by independently collecting and cleaning data, as well as building and iteratively optimizing regression models. The methodologies applied include OLS, lagged models, exponential models, and ARIMA, along with heterogeneity tests to ensure the robustness of our results.
