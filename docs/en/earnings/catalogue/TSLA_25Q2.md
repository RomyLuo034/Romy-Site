## âœ… Major Advances in Autonomy and Robotaxi Launch
- Tesla successfully launched its first fully autonomous robotaxi service in Austin, with plans to rapidly expand to additional U.S. cities pending regulatory approval.
- The company aims to have autonomous ride-hailing available to half the U.S. population by year-end, with a hyper-exponential increase in service areas and vehicles.
- Regulatory progress is being made in Europe and China, with expectations for supervised FSD approval to significantly boost demand in those regions.

## âœ… Strong Vehicle and Energy Business Performance Despite Headwinds
- Model Y became the best-selling car in multiple countries, and Tesla began ramping production of a new, lower-cost model, though the ramp will be slower due to U.S. EV credit changes.
- Automotive revenue increased 19% sequentially, outpacing delivery growth due to higher ASPs and improved product mix, even as tariffs and regulatory credit reductions created cost pressures.
- Energy storage and generation businesses achieved record gross profit, with Megapack and Powerwall deployments growing and margins improving despite tariff and policy challenges.


## âœ… Aggressive Investment in AI, Robotics, and Future Technologies
- Tesla is scaling up AI R&D, increasing parameter counts for FSD, and investing heavily in AI compute and chip design, including the upcoming Dojo 2 and AI5 chips.
- The Optimus humanoid robot program is advancing, with the Optimus 3 design expected to enter prototype production by year-end and scale to 100,000 units per month within five years.
- The company continues to invest in manufacturing, Cybercab, Semi, and AI infrastructure, with 2025 CapEx expected to exceed $9 billion.


## âœ… FSD Adoption and Subscription Growth Fueling Recurring Revenue
- FSD adoption rates in North America have increased 25% since the launch of version 12, with subscription pricing made more affordable and ongoing efforts to educate customers.
- Teslaâ€™s vehicles on FSD are reported to be 10x safer than those without, driving increased customer interest and setting new safety standards.
- The company expects FSD and robotaxi services to have a material financial impact by the end of next year, with cost per mile for Cybercab projected as low as $0.25.


## âœ… Strategic Outlook and Resilience Amid Policy and Market Changes
- Tesla is navigating the loss of U.S. EV credits, increased tariffs, and shifting regulatory environments by focusing on innovation, cost management, and product affordability.
- The company is preparing for a fundamental transformation from pre-autonomy to post-autonomy, with a new master plan in development to guide this transition.
- Leadership remains confident that successful execution in autonomy and robotics will make Tesla the most valuable company in the world, emphasizing long-term vision and adaptability.
